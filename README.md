## Introduction

This project is a machine learning application that predicts employee turnover using a Random Forest model. Employee turnover, or attrition, is a significant concern for organizations. Predicting which employees are likely to leave can help companies take proactive steps to reduce turnover.

The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and prediction. It uses employee-related features like satisfaction level, last evaluation, number of projects, average monthly hours, time spent at the company, work accidents, and more to make predictions about employee turnover.

## Features

The project includes the following components:

- `app.py`: The main Python script that loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, trains a Random Forest model, and provides predictions.

- `datasets_9768_13874_HR_comma_sep.csv`: The dataset used for training and prediction. It includes employee information, such as satisfaction level, last evaluation, number of projects, average monthly hours, time spent at the company, work accidents, and more.
